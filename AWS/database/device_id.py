# For 1 what you want is to run a Scan operation on a table.
# Scan Gets all the items of the list. 
#Depends on the API you are using, you can get only the hash key or
# any attributes you want.

# For 2 what you want is Query - which gets a hash attribute and
# returns all rows that have the hash attribute (can be more than one).
